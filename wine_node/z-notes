FIles:
server.js - entry point, creates the app and plugs everything together
routes/ - creates URL routes (wine_node/user) (wine_node/user/101) etc.
controllers/ - validates inputs, calls services/nodes
middleware/ - rules that apply before the logic runs(rejects bad requests, 
  contains security protocols like Authentication, Authorization, Rate limiting, 
  Input validation, IP allow/deny, CORS)
  also handles infrastructure needs like parsing, logging, error handling, etc. 
models/ - defines how data is stored and retrived in a database
.env - for secrets(api keys, port numbers, etc)
package.json - defines how to run the app





middleware answers, "should this request proceed?"
controllers answers, "How should this request be handled?"
